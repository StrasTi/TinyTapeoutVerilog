  title:        "4Bit-ALU"      # Project title
  author:       "Timon Strassern"      # Your name
  description:  "4Bit arithmetic logic unit perfomring arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers."     # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
